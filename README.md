# Chess!

A simple two-player chess game for the command line. All rules of chess are included, including castling and the infamous en-passant. Illegal moves are dissallowed including leaving the king in check. Checkmate is detected automatically.

Pieces are represented by lowercase (black) and uppercase (white) letters. They are K, Q, B, N (knight), R, and P.

Should be able to simply run with `java Chess`

Writted in high school with a friend of mine as a final project for a class.
